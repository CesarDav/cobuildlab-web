<title-2>What means Enterprise Software Development?</title-2>

The first thing you should know about this modality of software development is that it is a software whose goal is not to meet the needs of a specific person or a particular. Enterprise Software Development is intended to meet the needs of an organization that already exists and a system (maybe manual) that is in place.

This software development is developed based on an environment within an organization, which is where it is going to be used and where it is going to meet a goal.   

It is also known as Custom Software development, and as a result, you usually get useful tools to develop the business. An example of this type of software is an online payment processor, product catalogs, a process automation tool, a quick project management tool, systems integration or applications, forms, among others. 

Also, the development of software for enterprises models or marks the functioning of the organization, because once the solutions or tools are obtained, what happens is that they originate new methodologies and processes. 

In addition to setting the tone and offering solutions, Enterprise Software Development aims to improve efficiency, productivity, and business functionality. 

[Martin Fowler](https://martinfowler.com/), who is a prominent developer, and British speaker, considers that enterprise apps, which would be one of the results of software development for companies, are referred to the view, manipulation, and storage of large amounts of complex data generally, which lead to support and automation of business processes of the organization.
