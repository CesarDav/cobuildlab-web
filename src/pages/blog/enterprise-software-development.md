Although [software development](https://cobuildlab.com/blog/best-software-development-process/) is only one, if it is executed on startups for the development of new Software Products, or if it is applied on a company to replace a system, we can see certain particularities or aspects that change a little. 

But don't misunderstand us, it's [software development](https://cobuildlab.com/blog/best-software-development-process/) in essence, and the result will always be a software product or a software solution. For you to see this better, we will talk here about the Enterprise Software Development and make another posts about [Software Product Development](https://cobuildlab.com/blog/product-development-process-for-software-products/) when it comes to startups. Then you will draw your conclusions.

If you have an organization and want a software solution that automates processes or makes it more productive, this post will interest you very much. Let's get started!

<title-2>What means Enterprise Software Development?</title-2>

The first thing you should know about this modality of software development is that it is a software whose goal is not to meet the needs of a specific person or a particular. Enterprise Software Development is intended to meet the needs of an organization that already exists and a system (maybe manual) that is in place.

This software development is developed based on an environment within an organization, which is where it is going to be used and where it is going to meet a goal.   

It is also known as Custom Software development, and as a result, you usually get useful tools to develop the business. An example of this type of software is an online payment processor, product catalogs, a process automation tool, a quick project management tool, systems integration or applications, forms, among others. 

Also, the development of software for enterprises models or marks the functioning of the organization, because once the solutions or tools are obtained, what happens is that they originate new methodologies and processes. 

In addition to setting the tone and offering solutions, Enterprise Software Development aims to improve efficiency, productivity, and business functionality. 

[Martin Fowler](https://martinfowler.com/), who is a prominent developer, and British speaker, considers that enterprise apps, which would be one of the results of software development for companies, are referred to the view, manipulation, and storage of large amounts of complex data generally, which lead to support and automation of business processes of the organization.

In the same way, these enterprise apps serve a large number of users who are usually connected through a computer network.

<title-2>Particularities and characteristics of the Enterprise Software Development</title-2>

![enterprise-software-development-components](./media/entreprise-software-development-components.jpg)

Enterprise Software Development not only has a clear goal. Also, it has certain aspects that characterize it and doing it differently from standard or particular processes as well. 

These are organizations that already have the experience. They must control the resources, or the actions they perform so that their margin of error was lower because the consequences could be much more complicated if something were wrong. 

You can find out more about these special features below.

<title-3>Performance</title-3>

Of course, the performance of an app or enterprise software must be implicit. This type of software needs to work very well because they will be vital parts on processes within an organization, and often involve economic processes. 

As we well know, companies are like clocks. If something does not work well, the integral component of the organization will be affected. Precision and quality cannot postpone them. 

In addition to this, this type of software is usually very demanding. This software is used by many people simultaneously, and by different kinds of devices, ranging from desktop mobiles and sometimes can even be industrial. This high demand makes prevailing an excellent performance of the app or the software. 

That's why testing and quality control in enterprise software development is much more thorough.

<title-3>Scalability</title-3>

Scalability is a quality of any software product. A product that is not scalable will sink, be out of the market in a matter of time. 

Scalability determines the growth and advancement of the software, in functionality, in features, and any aspect deemed necessary. This growth, of course, should not affect the performance of the software. 

<title-3>Security</title-3>

Security is also another critical topic in enterprise software development, normally the most important. 

It is a subject that requires investment, specialists, and depth analysis. And we are not only talking about the security of computers, servers, and code. We are talking about cybersecurity for the employees or people who use it, for the information it handles, but also security for all the devices that make up this network. 

Attacks by cyber-criminals are increasingly harmful and not only compromise information but also infrastructure. If it is a medium or large organization, this topic is of special care and therefore tops the list of particularities of the Enterprise Software Development.

<title-3>Cost</title-3>

If you already have a company, you know that money and time matters a lot. That's why this topic is also dealt with a lot of particularities in software development processes for companies. 

When we talk about costs we mean to have a thorough planning and absolute control of all the monetary factor from phase 1 of the project, the initial investment, up to the maintenance costs after the soft launch of the MVP and the full launch of the product. 

If it is an organization that already exists, cost controls are much more rigorous because there are many existing items, and a small imbalance can have severe consequences for the development of the company. And there is also the issue of return on investment, which we will discuss in the following point.

<title-3>Fast ROI</title-3>

As we told you, the control of expenses in the development of business software is rigorous, and this includes an expectation of ROI or return on investment and the time in which it will have. 

This factor is a priority, and it is possible to measure it with indicators such as productivity, efficiency, and the impact of this on the overall budget (you earn or save more money or resources). 

In the development of software for business, the return on investment cannot be long term, should be estimated its start in the short or medium term, and once it happens should be documented to calculate also the profits of the development. You must always earn something for the organization because otherwise, it would not make sense to do so. 

<title-3>Interconnectivity</title-3>

More than one person almost always uses enterprise software that is developed, and sometimes simultaneously. Sometimes it even works through interconnected networks. And as if that weren't enough, it also usually interacts with other tools, devices and software. 

If this fact is not respected in a development project for a company, it can be very harmful to the internal processes of the organization that is using it. That is why this software must be very well integrated with the established workflow or improve it so much that it is not necessary to be integrated, but in general, it must.

<title-3>Robustness</title-3>

This topic is related to security, interconnectivity, and in definition, is the strength and support that characterizes a system or software for business. 

It must not only be developed with robust, proven, reliable, and secure technology. It must comply with minimum security standards; it must be compatible, versionable, easy to access and manage for authorized persons, it must have a record of the activities and processes it carries out and several qualities that make it a robust software. 

<title-3>Customization</title-3>

Each of these tools, as we said, is designed for a business environment and meet the needs of departments, teams, or employees of a company. But they are also tools that are usually customizable.

<title-3>Storage</title-3>

The issue of storage is critical. It is supposed to be considered with a lot of detail in enterprise software development. 

Not only because one works with large amounts of information, but also because this information must be stored in the best way because it can be used in the future. Either by audit, to measure productivity, see where it can be improved, business intelligence, etc

It must be stored and stored well. The cloud may be a good option, but today there are many more options, which the technology expert or the team that helps you develop the software must choose.
