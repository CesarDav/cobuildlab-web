The interesting thing about software development is that although your goal is always to build a product, there are many alternatives on how to do it, from a framework to the activities of the type of product to be developed and even the methodology of each development team. 

For this reason, we want to show you the way we work. The methodology we use for software development when we engage in the construction of new products for startups.


<title-2>What is Software Product Development?</title-2>

New product development refers to all actions that you must complete to create a new product, a value proposition that did not exist before to be released to the market. In this particular case, we would be talking about a software product. 

If we had to be more specific, we would define this process as the transformation of a market needs into a software product for sale or mass consumption. 
The development process of new software products is more of a methodology that we decided to establish internally. The reason? You will understand it later. Read a little more.


<title-2>Key factors of New Product Software Development?</title-2>


<title-3>1. The methodology</title-3>

We use a mix of two frameworks: [SCRUM](https://www.scrum.org/) and [XP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming).

The framework provides a series of tools, artefacts, and values that you should use, but how and when to use them, you decide. 

That's why we talk about that if we put together the tools of our framework (SCRUM+XP) with the how and when we use them, plus the activities that characterize software development, and we are in a project to develop a new software product, the result we get is a methodology to improve the product. 


<title-3>2. Management of end-user needs</title-3>

The development of new software products takes into account the needs of individuals, a specific market segment that is going to consume the solution. 

Based on that, a brainstorming is made to develop the user stories and the user interface of the first version of the app or the software with a minimum of technical requirements. 

This happens differently in the other methodology, which is Enterprise software because the needs of the end-user that are taken into account are those of work teams of an organization, and the technical and quality requirements are a little more rigorous.

<title-3>3. Quality Assurance and Security</title-3>

In the development of new products, especially of MVPs or prototypes, the rigour in the quality is not so high. The objective is to conceive a functional product, which may even have some bugs that will be corrected in later versions. 

What is important is to define the functionality and user experience, as well as the properties of the product and its purpose: the solution. 

The opposite happens in software development for companies, where even minimum quality and usability criteria are established, which must be achieved even in the first versions. That's why we say that quality is much more rigorous. 

The same goes for security. In the development of new software products is much more relaxed the level of protection in use and for users than in enterprise software development, and for this reason, is one of the critical factors of this methodology of software development. 

<title-3>4. Monitoring and Analytics</title-3>

Monitoring in new software product development projects is the key to understand [Customer Behaviour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_behaviour). A new product is introduced to the market with a high level of uncertainty, requiring feedback at all stages to understand and drive the development of new features and changes.

Next, we will tell you how to do it and, in addition, we will show you information that supports Android Apps development as the best way to succeed.
