Be productive is what we all want. It is a way to be fast, effective, and efficient. Be productive is the secret of success and the formula to get better your processes, your business, and overcome yourself day by day. Be productive is possible by maintaining efficient **workflows in your business** and your personal life, and we want to give you some tools and tips to do it easily.


<title-2>Everything you have to know about an efficient workflow</title-2>

Workflow is a pattern of actions or steps that you repeat constantly to do work or finishing a process. 

This pattern is involved in daily activities, methods, information, people, resources, the ability to handle daily tasks, tools, etc. 

It is a tool that makes the processes and activities in your company works in a good or a bad way, depending on how you are implementing it. 

Some years ago workflows were controlled by a physical person and all teams used tools like blackboards, notes, messages, and lists to maintain the efficiency. 

But now, thanks to technology everyone forgot those tools and now we have digital workflows where we have management tools that allow setting business rules to dictate when one step can be taken as successfully completed and the next step can be triggered. In that form, the workflow is automated and that translates on more efficiency.

<title-3>1. Say goodbye to multitasking</title-3>

If you want a team focused and really productive, it is imperative to assign specific tasks. That doesn’t mean that a person is not able to do more than one task. For sure he or she can do it, but they will be more efficient if they have one first and then the other. They will end faster and better every task. 

If you begin one task and you finish it to begin the other, you will work better.

<title-3>2. Finish first more difficult tasks</title-3>

More complex and difficult tasks need more concentration. So, they take more time. Once you finish them, it will be easier to complete the others faster. 

<title-3>3. Improve communications</title-3>

Being efficient also is thanks to good and constant communication between the people working around the same area, project or tasks and you can do it using the right tools.

Tools like [Slack](https://slack.com/intl/es/), where you can have a grupal channel for communication or private channels you talk with each member of your team directly, immediately, fastly, and effectively.

<title-3>4. Schedules are your best friend</title-3>

You and your team need to know in every moment in what they are working and which tasks they need to do during the day, the week, even the month. In that way, they plan how to accomplish them. All of this is possible to do it and to keep it with schedules. 

There are really nice tools as Google Calendar, Trello, Evernote, etc, that can help you with this.

<title-3>5. Be as transparent you can</title-3>

You can make public all assignments you make using a workflow tool. In that way, everyone in your team would work as a network. 

Another good reason to do it is that all people in your team will know in what is working his or her partners. That is transparency.

<title-3>6. Define and respect roles</title-3>

If everyone knows which work they need to do, they will be able to finish faster and more effectively. The action of assign and choose a responsible for every task is call:  **role definition**.

<title-3>7. If there is a tool that gets easier the work and the organization, use it!</title-3>
