The year is ending, and a good way to say goodbye is remembering amazing things that happened from the beginning. One of them was the interesting advances in **artificial intelligence in 2018.**

Artificial intelligence is a simulation of human intelligence made from machines or systems. How can they do it? Doing three basic actions: learning, reasoning, and self-correcting. This is the basic method of human intelligence. 

This kind of technology exists since some years ago but in this 2018 it has been more popular and needed in some cases.

Scientists created three methods: deep learning, artificial intuition, and machine learning. 

Before 2018 these three methods were separated but this year scientists of artificial intelligence worked hard to put them together and create powerful machines that have meta-learning. 

But, what meta-learning is? Meta-learning is a subfield of machine learning where automatic learning algorithms are applied to metadata about machine learning experiments.
