The **minimum viable product** (MVP) is the literal the first functional version of your software product. It is a goal achieved. The first version of an idea that can completely change your life. It is the first look of your app or software. It is the end of a phase and the beginning of the other at the same time.

An MVP better known as a Minimum Viable Product, it is the first and light version of your product, maybe an app or software. But this version should be completely functional, and also, it should have some projections to later versions. 

It is a first version that has the more quantity of knowledge and validated ideas with the less amount of efforts and resources. But it communicates perfectly the solution and the app goal. 

This first version is more than a beta or a test version. It is actually your app functioning 100%. But with the most essential features and the lower resources quantity as be possible. 

All of your favorite products now maybe had an MVP.
