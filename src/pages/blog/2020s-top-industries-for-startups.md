<title-3>* Micro-mobility in the Transportation Tech Industry</title-3>

The micro-mobility industry is a type of urban transportation, and this year it has been on fire.  

These devices work as an alternative to public transport and it has not stopped growing, to the point where Ford even acquired [Spin](https://www.spin.app/https://www.spin.app/) for $100 million. Now Ford has been investing even more resources making these devices more durable with a longer battery life.

Last year this industry was announced as a trend, and this prediction today is a reality.

Many people in our city use these devices to go to work quickly, without spending fuel, avoiding traffic, or worrying about parking.

Of course software development has been an integral part in the growth of this industry, making these vehicles a type of IoT devices since they’re linked of the web.

All is possible in this industry that has not stopped growing during 2019. 

What you need for having a startup in this industry is knowing enough or having someone on your team who knows about electric transportation technologies such as small and efficient batteries among other things..

You will also need a lot of capital, and knowledge on laws of the state where you're going to start.  In some states, these transportation devices are not yet legal, or the use is limited so consider this issue carefully. 

[Global revenues from electric bicycles are expected to increase $24.3 billion in 2025, $15.7 billion higher than 2016, according to Navigant Research.](https://www.inc.com/best-industries/index.html#back)

At the same time, many related micro-niches have been developing such as health for babies, elderly people, mothers, and much more.

This passion for healthcare [software development](https://cobuildlab.com/blog/best-software-development-process/) has been promoted in our country so much, that actually revenue last year was $36 billion and still  growing exponentially.
