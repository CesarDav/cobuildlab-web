Have you ever listened to every good thing in life has to be paid? Well, that’s not always true, especially when we talk about software. This world gives us the opportunity to get open source software that is available for everyone. And that's not all. It doesn’t mean less quality or usability comparing it with those we pay. From now on we will compare **Open Source Software vs. Proprietary Software** to know the advantages and disadvantages, examples, and how can you use them in the best way.  

<title-2>What is Open Source Software?</title-2>

In a few words, it is a kind of software that is available for everyone in the world to use, and it has the peculiarity that its code is open to developers. Surely you will ask, why does this happen? This makes possible that developers can change the code until it works the best for a specific project they are participating.

Engineers, customers, even developers love this kind of software because they can save effort, work, and time using something that it was already developed. And as if this wasn’t enough, they can personalize this main code and adapt it to their necessities. Sounds good, right?   

That’s not all! Open Source Software also can be shared with others. In a few words, once you have access, you can make whatever you want.  

<title-3>Is it the same open source and free software?</title-2>


We already know what means Software Open Source, but what happens with free software?

Although it seems to be the same, they aren’t. Open Source Software, how we saw, it is a software you can modify it and adapt it to your necessities. While free software, commonly, cannot be transformed. You can use it for free but only with qualities with it was created. It is not flexible at all.


<title-4>With free software you can:</title-4>
* Use the software.
* Run it.
* Understand who it works.
* Share and distribute it.
* Create another software only if you respect these aspects. 


And what you think? Software for commercial use also can be free software. Why? Well, if you respect all these points, you can charge a rate for distribution. 

<title-4>With Open Source Software you can:</title-4>

* Get access to the source code.
* Permission to change the software. 
* Free distribution of original and modified code. 
* Having derived work that can be distributed under the same terms of original software.
* The same license of the original software. You can take a new license, but it is not necessary.
* Sometimes, If you use it, it is not necessary that your program has to be open source too.


The principle here is to promote the collaboration inside a community to generate mutual benefits. 

Not all software open source is necessarily free. And free software can be also open source at the same time.


<title-2>Proprietary software meaning</title-2>

On the other hand, we have proprietary software, another kind of software that you have to bough if you want to use it.

This software belongs to someone else, but what does it mean? The code is closed, it is copyrighted, its use is limited at some point, especially when it is referred to distribution or modification. 

Proprietary software also is called commercial software or closed-source software inattention to one of its most important characteristics. 

This software also is really good and unique and sometimes, they can be modified within creators limits.  

Some of the most important software programs that revolutionized the world years ago were in this category.
