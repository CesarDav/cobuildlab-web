<title-2>REVIEW: Cobuild Lab was a sponsor of DevFest Miami!</title-2>

On September 28, CobuildLab was a Sponsor of the DevFest Miami that took place at the Wix.com offices in South Beach, Florida. 

[DevFest Miami](https://devfestmiami.org/) is an event organized by different Google Developers Groups (GDG) across the country, focused on community building and learning and exchanging knowledge and experiences about Google's technologies.

All the presentations were fascinating but [Claudio Luis Vera](https://www.linkedin.com/in/claudioluisvera/) inspired the crowd when he gave a different twist to what "accessible Technology for all" means. He explained to the audience that one of the goals we should have when creating software is to make sure that everyone can use your product, regardless of ability. 

Creating an app that even a blind or deaf person can use would be a milestone in software development. If most products on the market had that advantage, the communication barriers would fall for good.

[CobuildLab](https://cobuildlab.com/) founder, [Angel Lacret](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alacret), was one of the speaker attendees, sharing his experience as a technical Product Manager. He left behind the t)raditionalisms by explaining how the Google platform, [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/?hl=es-419), sets a new trend for software product development, helping us to work better with our customers.
