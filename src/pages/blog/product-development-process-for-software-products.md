**Product Development** is a process used to bring products to market and perfect business models. It is used for many types of businesses, but in this post, we will go deeper into this process applied to software development. Stay a little longer and find out everything. 


<title-2>Product Development as a process</title-2>

*“It is a group of steps that together fulfill the goal of conceptualizing, developing, and launching a new or rebranded product on the market based on the customers' demand. “*

It is kind of similar to the [Cobuild Process](https://cobuildlab.com/blog/cobuild-megatrend-in-the-startup-world/) we use to accelerate ideas, turn them into minimum viable products and profitable businesses. 

<title-2>The Product Development Process is composed for the next phases (Overview)</title-2>

Before starting this section, we must tell you that there are different frameworks for this development methodology and each framework has specific steps. But in general, this process has four phases that have to be accomplished no matter which framework you have chosen. And these are: 1) Concept phase, 2) Engineering phase, 3) Manufacturing Phase, 4) Marketing and commercialization Phase.

<title-3>Phase 1: Concept</title-3>

This generic phase is divided into three subpoints because the treatment given to the idea from the beginning is quite complicated. Start from the generation of all the senses, the review made, and the final conceptualization that will be the foundation of the business model and the product that will be presented as a solution. 

* **Idea Generation** 

In this first phase what you're going to feed on is as many ideas as possible. Business ideas, products, and everything you would like to incorporate into your project. There is no limit, or they do not have to be coherent with each other. It's just a list of ideas that you're going to place in no order specific order. 

You can base yourself on what some competitors do, on magazines, on what potential customers talk about or want, on a need you have or have detected in a market, or simply on your creativity. Anything goes at this stage. Even choose some technique for generating ideas such as brainstorming, group activities, surveys, etc.. 

This phase is fundamental because it is from this phase that the project will be built and the software or product will be developed. 

* **Review of ideas**

At this point, it is necessary to organize all the ideas from the previous phase, and then make a selection of the most viable, those that you consider most valuable and important to include in your development process. 

If you see that many of the things you thought disappear at this point, because after analyzing them you saw that they are unfeasible for many reasons (economic, legal, or any) don’t worry, it’s normal. Sometimes less is more, and effectiveness and efficiency start from being as concrete and simple as possible.  

Focus a lot on the market, on people's needs, on the solution you offer, and on how much it will cost you, how much you will have to invest. Keep only the essentials. 

* **Conceptualization** 

It is at this stage that ideas are really shaped. The necessary aspects are analyzed in greater depth, and all actions are aimed at bringing them to life in a plan. 

In this phase, it is common to perform practices such as [SWOT analysis](https://cobuildlab.com/blog/5-marveling-tips-that-lead-to-successful-entrepreneurship/) that translates the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats of your ideas. 

In this image, you can clearly see this practice which is almost like a religious practice that is done to a business model that is just being formulated.
