The **minimum viable product** (MVP) is the literal the first functional version of your software product. It is a goal achieved. The first version of an idea that can completely change your life. It is the first look of your app or software. It is the end of a phase and the beginning of the other at the same time.


How we said in a previous post, an MVP is a step of the  [first part of cobuild's process](https://cobuildlab.com/blog/cobuild-process-part-1/ ) and we consider that is one of the most important pieces to have success and begin the life-cycle of your product with the right hand.

This post is not only about what is an MVP. What we want with this article it shows you the process you have to follow in the construction of your MVP.
