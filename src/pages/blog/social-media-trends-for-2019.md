<title-3>Video marketing will continue strong</title-3>

Video marketing was strong this year. On the internet, we could see how videos take the first place. 

Predictions for the next year show more power and more video content as the key to success in and out of the internet. 

Statistics say that more than 80% of content on the internet will be videos. Also, brands that use videos catch better the attention of its customers. Google will continue loving them, and social media will be the first platforms to consume them.

<title-3>Influencer marketing</title-3>


It is a collaboration between brands. This marketing strategy was called strategic alliance before, but now is more than that, and the next year will continue advancing.

Even though both brands need to win something with the collaboration, on influencer marketing necessarily one brand must be an influencer, It has to have a good and strong presence on the internet, and the other should be less known. And how does work this marketing strategy? This influencer recommends your brand and his or her followers will be interested in your product or service. 

The [Digital Marketing Institute](https://digitalmarketinginstitute.com/blog/20-influencer-marketing-statistics-that-will-surprise-you) made a study where it showed up that 49% of consumers depend on influencer recommendations because they feel confident about influencers. They actually think that influencers know them better than their best friends. 

In the same study, they post statistics of Tomson about the money you can gain spending resources on influencers. They say you can get $6,50 for each dollar spent on influencers.

<title-3>Chatbots as protagonists</title-3>

It is a computer that uses artificial intelligence for talking and make a conversation with customers or people that need information. 

“Such programs are often designed to convincingly simulate how a human would behave as a conversational partner, thereby passing the Turing test. Chatbots are typically used in dialog systems for various practical purposes including customer service or information acquisition”.[Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot)

This technology helps to reinforce and facilitate the direct and instant contact with clients that is so required nowadays. 

That’s why the next year, chatbots will be on demand.

<title-3>More vertical videos</title3>

We know, once again we talk about videos, and we are not joking when we say “they are and will be the protagonist”. 

This trend for 2019 is about videos on a vertical format, as the Instagram TV (IGTV). This year we see even on Youtube and Facebook ads videos with this format. People make lots of videos like this and Instagram, the second social media platform with higher use in the world is winning this battle until now. So, Why not do some vertical videos?

Statistics maybe convince you.
