This is a third of the list of new proposals of Google for companies that want to earn money with advertisement or just publish ads in a market created by the huge company of information. **Google Ad Manager** is the last of the platform that was launched last year, and here, we'll see everything we need to know and start using this tool. 


<title-2>Google Ad Manager overview</title-2>

Google Ad Manager is a free platform designed to manage advertising of a website. Specifically, it is an integrated advertising management platform that was launched last July for Google. 

This platform allows you to monitor the progress of your ads and best of all, optimize them so you can earn more money. 

Google Ad Manager works as another real-time marketplace where advertising is bought and sold on the Google Display network. 

Here are incorporated functions of [DoubleClick for Publishers](https://www.google.com/dfp/) and [DoubleClick Ad Exchange](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/www.google.com/en//adexchange/AdExchangeOverview.pdf).

And the best thing about this platform is that all its benefits are the same, regardless of the medium through which the ads are displayed, which can be through applications and games for mobile phones, smart TVs, pages, and others. 

Google Ad Manager works very well in coordination with Google Ads. Actually, you can publish Google Ads ads on Ad Manager's publisher sites.

Its main goal and reason for being is monetization thanks to the optimization and the segmentation of your ads, which is another of the benefits of this Google Ad Manager marketing tool. 

<title-2>Here are the key elements of the Google Ad Manager network</title-2>

**1. Inventory**

That is the advertising space that is available for being sold. 

This element is composed of: 
* **Blocks of ads**, which are the spaces where ads can be made and can also have labels;
* **The positions**, which are a grouping of ad blocks; 
* And **the value keys**, which allow you to define custom search criteria.

**2. Publications**

That can be made once the entire inventory is in place. 

This second element has a start and end date. As well as the creative element, in terms of the resource, you are going to use. The video, the image, and the content that you are going to direct to the users.

**3. Users**

Another interesting thing about this tool is that it lets you know who is accessing your network, and keep track of this.
