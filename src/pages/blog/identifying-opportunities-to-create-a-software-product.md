The world of entrepreneurship is about opportunities. About business opportunities, market opportunities, opportunities to develop an idea, etc. But these opportunities often have to be worked on or found. They do not come by themselves and even less today that we have so many saturated markets, a lot of information, a lot of offers, a lot of software solutions, etc.

That's why we decided to create this post,  so that you know how to search, identify, and work in and opportunity for developing it, make it relevant, effective, and efficient, and more critical, transform it into a software that satisfies a market need, and above all, your personal and business expectations. Welcome, and let the action begin.

<title-2>Identify an opportunity to create a software product</title-2>

If you want to start a software business and to find an opportunity in this market, you must know that there are **three essential processes** which you must do.

The first process it is **the context**; we mean all personal conditions of your life, as well as the conditions of the environment that surrounds you, your experience, relationships and connections.

The second is **idea generation**, that way of calling and organizing ideas, finding an exciting proposal to do, and unleash creativity.

And finally, there is the **process of innovation**. A word that you have heard a lot, and we will define concretely, and find some practices because it is fundamental. Especially for seeing an opportunity in the software market.

<title-2>Process 1: Evaluate your Context</title-2>

The context is your reality. What you have? Who are you? What do you do? What problems or situations you have? What you surround yourself? How do you do it? All that information about the environment in which you are, which conditions how ideas reach you. That can inspire you as well as stagnate you. That's why it's so important, because the conditions of the environment will have an influence on your creative process and development as a software entrepreneur.

Therefore, if you don't have an ideal environment for the constant and free flow of ideas for business or ideas for any project, it's likely that you won't find an opportunity or you will find an opportunity that is not the best. 

This context has the following constitutive elements:

* **Work Experience** because experience gives you learning and background that often surpasses the theory, a market or a type of products. It is not the same as a person who has no experience in business processes develops [Enterprise Software](https://cobuildlab.com/blog/enterprise-software-development/), as one who does have the knowledge and is even more involved with the process that is going to be automated with the software product. 

* **Relationships and connections** due to the alliances, you can get and all the contributions that third parties can give you. That's why people say that two heads think better than one.

* **Problems that you are facing and that you have resolved**. The opportunity on the market will be determined for the problem you can solve to a group of people with your software.

* **A creative environment**. If you are in the wrong space your ideas will not flow.

* **What you have studied.** You will need enough knowledge and comprehension of an area, situation, and even a type of people to determine the correct opportunity. 

* **Passed experiences with software products.** Every experience gives you an idea of what might and might not work. [If you think as a consumer you will better understand what your consumers want](https://cobuildlab.com/blog/customer-development-process/), and past experiences with software can help you with this issue, even if in this first process, do not develop your ideas as such, but simply collect and become aware of that knowledge you already have with you, to begin your creative process.  

* **Your desires or dreams as people.** There is no better engine to find opportunities and see things that others do not than desires. A goal you want to achieve. Your software product. It is recommended that you give form to that context of your life, before starting the ideation phase. 

* **Your routine of to-dos.** Routines and things to do, help you get organized, develop your discipline, and know everything you need to optimally exploit the creative process until you find the opportunity you have always wanted to create a software product.
