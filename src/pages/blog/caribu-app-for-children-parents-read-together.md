Caribu lets you **video-call** and reads together no matter where you are, so you never miss another story time. This **Miami-based startup**
integrates children’s books into a **child-friendly app**, providing a truly engaging communication experience for kids and their families.
The education platform helps parents, family, and mentors read and draw with children when they’re not together.
