<title-2>Now, enjoy these Leadership tips</title-2>


<title-3>1. Make a template of your management</title-3>

When you have enough information for establishing activities and goals for the team, develop your plan and present it in a template to the them. . That way, everyone will know the macro plan and better understand just how important each of their responsibilities are.

In the development of a software product, every piece is fundamental, it has to work like clockwork. If any member doesn’t fulfill their responsibility or reach the goal assigned, they will affect the whole development cycle of the project, wasting time, and in a best case scenario, you will lose money. At worst, the quality could be affected, hindering your company’s growth or even damaging your company’s reputation. 

<title-3>2. Be as humble and accessible as you can</title-3>

Humility, empathy, and confidence are essential characteristics of a leader. When you are responsible for many aspects (technical or not) you are likely to feel pressured. Or on the contrary, if you feel so comfortable in a position of authority that can change your kind attitude, respect, empathy, and openness for other members of your team. Avoid this type of situation, since you would go from being a good leader to a bad boss, and this position is an antonym to the expected one.

<title-3>3. Communicate as much as you can with your team</title-3>

You can use any tools you want for this or do it face to face. The most important thing is that you always talk to the people who make up your team. This way, they know each other and get along better. With better communication you will be able to better motivate your team, transmit ideas, and get immediate feedback from those who are going to support you to make your dream a reality. 

<title-3>4. Identify and set your priorities, then share them</title-3>

There are important, unimportant, urgent, and non-urgent things. There is a prioritization exercise in which a picture is drawn divided into four spaces with these characteristics in each sector. The division would be this way:

The prioritization exercise consists of finding a balance between things that are urgent and things that are important, and based on that prioritize activities, goals, and everything that the team must undertake. This sense of prioritization is necessary to be effective and efficient in the final result, to work in an organized way based on the plan you make. But this effort must come from you, and then your team will follow your guidelines and even be able to prioritize their activities by their own initiative. 


<title-3>5. Listen more, talk less</title-3>

Meeting team members, listening to them and making them feel important, because they are, is another of the qualities and tips for being a good leader. By listening to expectations, doubts, concerns, suggestions, and any information from your team, you can get valuable data that would help you to improve processes, activities, and even final results. A leader should merely be the head of a complete team.


As an example, it could happen that according to your own personal methodology you perform a certain task in a certain specific way, maybe not the best way. By listening more and keeping the channels of communication wide open with the rest of your team, you’ll create a culture where if one of the members of your team considers that your way it’s not the best way to proceed, they could present to you with another way that could work better than yours. By just listening and being open to your team’s opinions it could bring exciting things to them, to you as a leader, and of course to your project.

This doesn’t mean that you should not have your own criteria, or that you are not going to speak your mind. You must give guidelines and above all, instruct and inform your team, but no matter what type of leadership you choose, listening to others is a leader’s *sine qua non..*

<title-3>6. Be as honest as possible</title-3>

Openness is a good leader quality. It is not synonymous with being rude, so be careful with that. But you should speak clearly, openly, and sincerely to your team members, partners, allies and everyone who will be involved in your project. In all forms of communications, whether public or private, you should be as transparent, open ‘and’ active as possible. This quality is known as effective communication. 

For example, if you want to communicate to one of the guys on your team, a message that you find uncomfortable or not the most enjoyable. It’s important that you try to meet him, be helpful, but tell him transparently what's not working. Doing it in person is essential and valuable. 

<title-3>7. Define the roles and responsibilities of each person</title-3>

A good leader knows the strengths and weaknesses of everyone involved in their project; if not, r try to discover them at least. And based on that, the leader will establish responsibilities and roles within the team. 

It would be wrong if, for example, you put a layout designer to work in the back-end of your application. Although the person may have a conceptual idea of the back-end. They most likely will not be able to contribute at all to your team, you must identify their strength and make the most of it. 

Sometimes, the best teams aren't made up by the most talented people in the world. They are rather a well-engaged team, working to their strengths, each member adding their grain of sand to get an excellent [software product.](https://cobuildlab.com/blog/software-development-for-new-products/)

If you’re not an expert in the technicalities of Software Development, you may feel your team is incomplete, but remember you could ask for help from a software development company or also a [technical co-founder](https://cobuildlab.com/blog/co-founders/). Whatever it is, make sure that each person has an  assigned responsibility, that they know it, and that  matches their strengths.
