What is promised is debt and this post is proof of that. In the last post, we talked about the [most popular programming languages](https://cobuildlab.com/blog/most-popular-programming-language/) in 2018 and part of this year. But that information is not enough if you are developing software or at least you are [planning to do it](https://cobuildlab.com/blog/planning-a-software-project/). One of the most important things is the **tech stack** or technology stack that you choose. So, we make this post to clarify this task and to give you a guide about how to do it.


<title-2>First of all, the meaning of tech stack</title-2>

A technology stack is a group of software, programming languages, and tools used to create and develop a website, web, mobile or desktop application, etc, in all of its sides, we mean on the client-side and server-side.

This type of architecture that separates these two worlds is known as client-server architecture or API architecture.

**In the previous image, you can see on the server side the Database component, this is a real depth topic that we will see in a later post. It is a promise!**

Going back to the subject of the sides of an application or websites, the server side also is known as the back-end, and the front-end is referred to the client side. 

This separation is important because for each side you will have to choose software,  programming language or a framework to use, and each of these technologies is part of your tech stack. 

What does it mean?

<title-3>This means that your tech stack is conformed by the following components</title-3>

* **Back-end tech stack**

All components that are part of this stack are the managers of the logic or the Business Logic. They work behind the scene because the end user will never have direct contact with them. 

An example of a back-end tech stack is the famous [LAMP](https://bitnami.com/stack/lamp/installer) which is Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP. 

When you choose a programming language for the back-end, like Python, then you will have to select a framework written in the same language. 

Frameworks will provide you with implementations for some common features for applications like user authentication, data access, validations, serialization, etc. 

This is an example of famous languages with frameworks:

**Python and [Django Framework](https://www.djangoproject.com/)**
**Javascript with [ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com/)**
**Javascript or Typescript with [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI75zRlIDI4AIVxEOGCh344AFaEAAYASAAEgLdCvD_BwE)**
**Javascript or Typescript [8base](https://www.8base.com/)**

Now, there are two new trends that are in the Serverless computing options. We personally use them. 

With the first, you won’t have to manage the infrastructure of your servers. You just will have to hire a service that does that for you. The companies that bring this service called “Infrastructure as a Service” are providers with public clouds such as [Amazon AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/?nc1=f_ls), [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/gcp/?hl=es&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=latam-LATAMsp-all-es-dr-skws-all-all-trial-p-latam-1003997-LUAC0000385&utm_content=text-ad-none-any-DEV_c-CRE_257142192891-ADGP_SKWS%20%7C%20PHR%20~%20Cloud-KWID_43700030076822949-kwd-171201442-userloc_1028573&utm_term=KW_cloud-ST_cloud&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIuc7I1IDI4AIVA0GGCh14QgqyEAAYASAAEgI03_D_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds), [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/), and [IBM](https://www.ibm.com/ve-es/?ar=1).

The second trend is called “SAAS” which means software as a service. With these services, you don’t only have someone that manage the servers you, you will also have software and tools for building yourself your Business Logic usually using a friendly interface and a few services and languages of the back-end. The last two examples we showed you are inside of this category (Firebase and 8base) and we use them.

* **Front-end tech stack**

These components will give to you the visual part of the application. This is the face of your app or web page which users will see and interact. 

Front-end tech stack usually is made on HTML, CSS or Javascript and usually, people use a framework too, but they are optional. Some of the most popular frameworks in this category are written on Javascript:[ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) for web and [React Native](https://react-native.shop/elements?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIpNra4oq-4AIVRkCGCh3gTwLqEAAYASAAEgJW-_D_BwE)or mobile. These are what we use, but there are other options like [AngularJS](https://react-native.shop/elements?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIpNra4oq-4AIVRkCGCh3gTwLqEAAYASAAEgJW-_D_BwE), [VueJs](https://vuejs.org/), [Backbone.Js](https://backbonejs.org/),etc.

<title-3>Other options for tech stacks</title-3>

There are other options for tech stack mainly for web pages. This architecture is known as a monolithic approach because with a unique stack you can build the whole system, for example, [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com/create/?currency=USD&utm_source=adwords&utm_medium=cpc&keyword=wordpress&creative=263010903764&campaignid=655562327&adgroupid=55312602867&matchtype=e&device=c&network=g&&sgmt=gb&utm_source=adwords&utm_campaign=Google_WPcom_Search_Brand_Desktop_RoW_en&utm_medium=cpc&keyword=wordpress&creative=263010903764&campaignid=655562327&adgroupid=55312602867&matchtype=e&device=c&network=g&targetid=kwd-313411415&locationid=1028573&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI_b6tqZO-4AIVjVmGCh28twZFEAAYASAAEgLt0vD_BwE) or [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/).

<title-2>Tips for choosing the tech stack</title-2>

<title-3>1. Mobile or web</title-3>

This is really important because depending on the final destination you would use a determined technology, programming language, etc. 

As we said before, for the web we use[ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) while for mobile we use [React Native](https://react-native.shop/elements?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIpNra4oq-4AIVRkCGCh3gTwLqEAAYASAAEgJW-_D_BwE) when we are building the user interface. So, the front-end tech stack changes depending on the destination of your software. Think and define this before choosing.

<title-3>2. Responsiveness</title-3>

If you are developing an app for web, but you know that a good percent of your final users will visit your software by their mobile phone or tablet, don’t forget to add tools on your tech stack that make your website or web app responsive. 

Here applies the principle of “mobile first”. A huge percent of users navigate on the internet using their mobile devices. To be more exact, [more than 60% of people do this](https://svsg.co/how-to-choose-your-tech-stack/), so this is more than a desire it is an absolute necessity. 

For web the most popular option is [Bootstrap.](https://www.ostraining.com/blog/webdesign/bootstrap-popular/)

<title-3>3. Simple and easy(agile)</title-3>

When you are choosing your tech stack don´t forget: less is more. If your project is simple don’t complicate it with complex and many elaborate technologies. On the contrary, make it easier and agile. 

Choose the minimal but functional components of your stack. In that way, you save time and your team will feel better and more comfortable building your software app or web.

For example, ExpressJs is built to start very simple and faster, and Django it has more steps to be set up but it has more tools to use.

<title-3>4. Think twice in your requirements</title-3>

Though you cannot believe it, depends on what you want and what you need, a specific language works better than others. 

For example, if you are developing on machine learning, a big data project or any project related to artificial intelligence, Python is a better language than others because this is its specialty. 

You just investigate and consult to specialists and be sure of your tech stack is the better option to your project.

Python is very popular in data analytics because it has many libraries and tools developed for this area, whereas [Java](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/newtojava/learn-141096.html).

<title-3>5. Bet for open source technologies</title-3>
