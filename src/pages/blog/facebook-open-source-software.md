Some days ago we share with you important information about [open source software](https://cobuildlab.com/blog/software-open-source-vs-proprietary-software/) in comparison with proprietary software. Now, we focus on Open Source software and we will do it from the perspective of one of the biggest technology monsters: Facebook. 

**Facebook Open Source Software** is most common that you may think nowadays and this is because Facebook’s software works well, and developers in the world can make it even better.

<title-2>Why Facebook is promoting Open Source Software?</title-2>

They have lots of reasons. One of them is that Facebook is a customer of open source software. In the beginning, the giant platform was built from a combination of Linux, Apache, Mysql, and PHP that is called LAMP platform. 

Also, we can make this assumption: If you were Facebook's owner which would be the strategy to find new and good engineers? 

For Mark and other executives of Facebook, the best strategy to find new people for this team it is searching in some of these open and collaborative platforms. 

Another reason for Facebook’s contribution with open source software development it could be the opportunity to get better its platform thanks to others’ contribution. 

Actually, they have GitHub accounts from its backend and frontend. If you want you can make a suggestion or visit it. 

In conclusion, Facebook is pro open source software from the beginning of the platform, and they will continue to be.

ReDex is an Android bytecode (dex) optimizer originally developed at Facebook. It provides a framework for reading, writing, and analyzing .dex files, and a set of optimization passes that use this framework to improve the bytecode. An APK optimized by ReDex should be smaller and faster than its source.

From F8 developer conference, Facebook launched this tool for Android. Basically, redex can make faster the Android Software using a few tweaks from the developers.

It is an Android accelerator that Facebook used to make 15% faster its open speed, and also this technology it is responsible for Facebook to be 25% more responsive. 

That was so good for Facebook’s team that they cannot save it just for them, and that's why we can have redex now.

<title-4>Specifically, these are the co-founder functions</title-4>

This topic will change depending on the co-founder input. For example, if the co-founder invests economical resources, it is usual that he or she can decide about finance and the proper way to use the money. Now, it is common that co-founders don’t contribute with money, but they contribute with knowledge. In this specific case, responsibilities and functions should be different. 

What does it mean? Co-founders functions are not always the same. They will change in every company, and you as a founder can establish it how better you think. 

But we want to give you some common functions of co-founders to keep in mind:

1. Select the team’s members with you
2. Make a distribution about economic resources
3. Contribute to knowledge 
4. Plan strategies of some processes
5. Identify and take advantage of market opportunities
6. Promote the brand
7. Propose ideas for marketing and sales
8. Collaborate with business documentation 
9. Calculate financial estimates 
10. Collaborate with internal processes when it has been necessary
