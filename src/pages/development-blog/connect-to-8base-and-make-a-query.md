## 8base

**8base** is a Backend-as-a-Service. It lets front-end developers focus more on what they love and backend developers expedite their workflow. As our CEO likes to say, "it's totally awesome!"

When using 8base, you're project benefits from having:

1. A fully scalable serverless API
2. A managed MySQL Database that's hosted on AWS
3. Ready-to-use app services, like Authentication, Authorization, and File Storage
4. 8base's rock-star team and the Community
5. So, so, so much more!

## Connect to 8base

### 1. First we go to the 8base [documentation](https://docs.8base.com/getting-started/quick-start) and Clone the Demo Repository

    git clone https://github.com/8base/react-8base-starter-app.git

### 2. Then we go into the project folder and do an npm install

### 3. Configuraci√≥n del cliente

    APP_WORKSPACE_ENDPOINT=<workspace_endpoint>
    APP_AUTH_PROFILE_ID=<auth_profile_id>
    APP_AUTH_CLIENT_ID=<auth_client_id>
    APP_AUTH_DOMAIN=<auth_domain>

Look for a 8base-starter-app/client/.env file that contains a template for the required environment variables. Fill in the template with all appropriate values. Each starter app will have a thorough READme.md with instructions on which files are responsible for which functionality. Please read them!

### 4. Run the application with the NPM STAR command

## To execute a query

```javascript
import React from 'react'
import { useQuery } from '@apollo/react-hooks'
import gql from 'graphql-tag'

const TASK_LIST_QUERY = gql`
  {
    tasksList {
      count
      items {
        name
        description
        createdAt
      }
    }
  }
`

const Home = () => {
  const { data, loading, error } = useQuery(TASK_LIST_QUERY)
  console.log(`DEBUG:`, data, loading, error)

  if (loading === true) return <div className={'loading'}>Loading...</div>

  const {
    tasksList: { items },
  } = data

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Tasks!</h1>
      {items.map((task, i) => (
        <p key={i}>{task.name}</p>
      ))}
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Let's explain what we did here

- We imported React
- We import useQuery from @apollo/react-hooks that is not used to make the query
- We import graphql-tag gql that will help us write the query
  In the **TASK_LIST_QUERY** constant we store the query using gql
- We created a functional component called **Home**
  Inside that component we make a destructuring of objects to useQuery ue resive as prametro the constant that we created
- We ask if loading exites and return a div indicating the load
- We make a double desestructuration to **data** and extract **item**
- Finally we return a div with all the names of the list
